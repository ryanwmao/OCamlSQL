#Installation

1. After opening the zip file, type ''make build'' in the terminal to build our system.
2. Now type ''make demo'' in the terminal: this is our demo for MS1 and shows the current visible functionality of our system.

#Demo/Run
0. After running 'make demo', you will be asked to type in an SQL query; we will print out the tokenized and sorted version of this query.
1. You will be prompted after running ''make demo'' to type in a file name. Type in the file name with data that you would like to import. 
NOTE: The file must be formatted in CSV format and must be located inside the OCamlSQL folder. 
2. You will next be prompted to type in the file name that you would like to export data to. We have provided an empty demo.txt file that you may use. 
NOTE: Your output file may become cluttered after exporting various times. To fix this, you can either create a new txt file or open the current output file and delete the data contained.
