#Installation

1. After opening the zip file, type ''make build'' in the terminal to build our system.
2. Now type ''make demo'' in the terminal: this is our demo for MS2 and shows our latest feature.

#Demo/Run
After running 'make demo', you will be asked to type in an SQL query; this can currently
only be of the form "select X from Y", where X are existing column names from the csv-formatted
files in Y. For example, "Select 1958, Month from airtravel.csv" is a supported query.
The output of every demo session query is located in the demo.txt file, which can be
manually cleared as needed. 

The demo file displays each selected column as a row, in the order that they 
were entered in to the "X" field in the example query above.
