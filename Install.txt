#Installation

1. After opening the zip file, type ''make build'' in the terminal to build our system.
2. Now type ''make demo'' in the terminal: this is our demo for our submission.

#Demo/Run
After running 'make demo', you will be prompted with a request to load files.
These entries can be entered as the table name, followed by a space, and the
file from which the table will be read. Click enter to add another table or 
type "done" to proceed. 

Next, you will be prompted to enter SQL commands. Currently, all commands keywords
must be capitalized, and we support SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and INNER JOIN.
NOTE that integer columns are in quotes

Some examples:
after entering "air1 airtravel2.csv" "air2 airtravel2.csv" in the first step,

SELECT "1958" FROM air1 WHERE 1958 > 400 
SELECT "1958" * 2 FROM air1
SELECT Y1958, Y1959 FROM air2 
SELECT Y1958, Y1959 FROM air2 ORDER BY Y1958
SELECT Y1958, Y1959 FROM air1 INNER JOIN air2 WHERE air1.Y1958 = air2.Y1958
